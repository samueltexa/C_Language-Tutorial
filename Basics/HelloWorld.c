#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello!, world.");
    return 0;
}

// Now let's go through it line by line:

// #include <stdio.h>: This line includes the header file stdio.h, which stands for standard input/output.
// It provides functions like printf and scanf for input and output operations.

// int main() {: This line marks the beginning of the main function, which is the entry point of a C program.
// Execution starts from here.

// printf("Hello, World!\n");: This line uses the printf function to display the string "Hello, World!"
// on the console. The \n represents a newline character, which adds a line break after the output.

// return 0;: This line indicates the end of the main function and returns the value 0 to the operating system.
// In C, returning 0 from main typically signifies successful program execution.

// Now, when you compile and run this program, it will display "Hello, World!" on the console.
// The printf function is used to print formatted output, and in this case, it simply displays
// the provided string.

// Note: The program should be saved with a .c extension (e.g., hello.c) and compiled using a C compiler
// to generate an executable file that can be run.
